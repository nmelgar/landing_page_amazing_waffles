# landing_page_amazing_waffles
This was a project created as part of my course from Freecodecamp.org, "Responsive Web Design Certification".<br>
All the code was written by me.<br>
The project was also created as image on Figma by me. https://www.figma.com/file/bhATCiUtC1bbq9RZ3pbfGz/landing_page_amazing_waffles?node-id=0%3A1 <br>
Here's the codepen of the project https://codepen.io/nmelgar/pen/zYNWyWm (It's not exactly as expected in the FreeCodeCamp course :)) <br>
